## Lessons learned

`wasm` is difficult to get started, but working and tinkering around is helpful.
The wasm-bindgen macro is only useful to make the interface for the JavaScript side.
Minimising the interface allows for keeping most Rust primitives.
Still need to read more about `wasm`.
Excited to bring more compiled applications to the web.
